# JapaneseLearning

This repository contains a collection of materials for learning Japanese, specifically Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana, and basic vocabulary. The HTML pages in this project provide a simple and clear way to practice and learn these contents. The main purpose of this website is to allow access to learning materials from anywhere.

## Structure and Contents

- **Lernen.html** - An overview of the different learning materials.
- **Vokabeln.html** - A list of basic Japanese vocabulary.
- **Kanji.html** - Contains a collection of Kanji and their meanings.
- **Images** - A folder containing various images for the project.

## Usage

Simply open the HTML files in a web browser to access the learning content. As long as the files can be opened in a browser, you will have access to the materials anytime and anywhere.

## Notes

Since the website is stored locally on your computer or in your GitHub repository, no additional installation or setup is required. Just make sure that all files (including the **Images** folder) are stored together in one location so that images and content load correctly.
